# Spiral Path

[`Spiral Path`](http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-manns-proposal) is a circular gravel path in a wooded area. When traveled in a counter-clockwise direction, the trail is continuously uphill, even after reaching the original point. When traveled in a clockwise direction, the trail shows the same amount of uphill and downhill travel, as expected.
